This repository provides the data and code to reproduce the results for [Beranek and Castillo 'Continuous Inclusion of Other in the Self'](https://geoffreycastillo.com/pdf/Beranek,Castillo-Continuous-Inclusion-of-Other-in-the-Self.pdf).

# Use

In Stata, `cd` to the folder where you have downloaded or cloned the repository, then run the files in `code/`, first `01 build.do`, then `02 analysis.do`.

The data is in `redacted-data/`. 
With `data.dta` you can start directly with `02 analysis.do`.

# Variables

Most variables have a value label in Stata.
We also offer a description of the variables in the file `variables-description.csv`.
